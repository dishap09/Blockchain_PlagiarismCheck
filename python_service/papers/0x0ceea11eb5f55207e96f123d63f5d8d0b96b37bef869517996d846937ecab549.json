  "title": "Revolutionizing Blockchain Scalability with DAG-Based Consensus2",
  "content": "Scalability remains one of the most significant hurdles in the mainstream adoption of decentralized systems. Conventional blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin suffer from limited transaction processing capabilities due to their sequential architecture and reliance on Proof-of-Work mechanisms. An innovative approach, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), challenges this model by discarding the notion of blocks altogether. Instead, each transaction connects to several prior ones, enabling parallel verification and significantly boosting throughput.\n\nTechnologies such as IOTA\u2019s Tangle and Nano\u2019s block-lattice exemplify the effectiveness of DAG structures in delivering faster, more energy-conscious transactions. Additionally, DAG-based systems reduce reliance on miners, fostering a more democratic and accessible network validation process.\n\nIn this work, we introduce a hybrid architecture that combines the robustness of conventional blockchains with the performance advantages of DAGs. A working prototype is developed and compared to major blockchain ecosystems. Our benchmarking indicates a threefold increase in transactions per second (TPS) and a 65% decrease in confirmation times. A tailored Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) model is also integrated to mitigate risks from malicious nodes within the DAG.\n\n",
