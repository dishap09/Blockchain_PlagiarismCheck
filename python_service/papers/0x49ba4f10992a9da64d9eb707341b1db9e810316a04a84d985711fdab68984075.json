  "title": "Revolutionizing Blockchain Scalability with DAG-Based Consensus",
  "content": "Blockchain scalability has long been a bottleneck in the adoption of decentralized technologies. Traditional blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, struggle with transaction throughput due to their linear structure and Proof-of-Work consensus algorithms. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) present a compelling alternative by eliminating the block structure entirely. Each transaction is directly linked to multiple previous transactions, allowing concurrent validations and dramatically increasing throughput.\n\nDAG-based models like IOTA's Tangle and Nano's block-lattice structure have demonstrated improved performance in terms of transaction speed and energy efficiency. Moreover, DAGs reduce the dependency on miners, leading to a more inclusive and equitable validation system.\n\nThis paper proposes a hybrid DAG-Blockchain architecture that retains the security of traditional blockchains while leveraging the scalability of DAGs. We implement a prototype model and benchmark it against leading blockchain platforms. Our results show a 3x improvement in transactions per second (TPS) and a 65% reduction in confirmation latency. We also present a modified Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanism to handle malicious actors in the DAG structure.\n\n",
