  "title": "A Distributed Ledger Approach to Peer Review",
  "content": "The peer review process is a critical component of academic publishing, yet it often lacks clarity and accountability. Existing systems largely depend on trust and are prone to biases, potential manipulation, and insufficient recognition for reviewers.\nIn this work, we present a blockchain-based framework that securely logs peer review actions on a distributed ledger. Each review is cryptographically linked to both the manuscript and the reviewer, anonymized when necessary, and timestamped to ensure auditability and data integrity.\nOur model utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to handle the review workflow, while IPFS is employed for storing larger files like paper drafts and review documents off-chain. Reviewers are rewarded with tokens as an incentive for timely and quality feedback.\nSimulation results indicate that our method improves transparency, enables clear tracking of revisions, and fosters increased engagement from qualified reviewers. This approach could significantly enhance the fairness and efficiency of the peer review landscape.",
