  "title": "Revolutionizing Blockchain Scalability with DAG-Based Consensus3",
  "content": "Blockchain scalability has long been a bottleneck in the adoption of decentralized technologies. Traditional blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, struggle with transaction throughput due to their linear structure and Proof-of-Work consensus algorithms. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) present a compelling alternative by eliminating the block structure entirely. Each transaction is directly linked to multiple previous transactions, allowing concurrent validations and dramatically increasing throughput.\n\nDAG-based models like IOTA's Tangle and Nano's block-lattice structure have demonstrated improved performance in terms of transaction speed and energy efficiency. Moreover, DAGs reduce the dependency on miners, leading to a more inclusive and equitable validation system.\n\nThis paper proposes a hybrid DAG-Blockchain architecture that retains the security of traditional blockchains while\n\n",
